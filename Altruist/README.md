# Altruist Air Quality Bundle

A dual-module smart air monitor for indoor and outdoor purposes: measure urban dust (PM), outdoor noise, bedroom CO₂, and compare temperature and humidity indoor vs outdoor. No forced clouds, fully compatible with Home Assistant, open to DIY and modding. Optional integration with open source cloud for trusted distributed storage and air quality map service — [sensors.social](sensors.social).

The bundle contains two devices:

- [Altruist Urban](Urban) — module for measuring urban dust and outdoor noise;
- [Altruist Insight](Insight) — module that measures CO2 and displays data from both modules on the E-ink display.

The bundle was presented in the Indiegogo campaign in 2025:
